            <h1>The Wolf is still not Among Us</h1>
            <p>Despite having been promised since around 2023, it has been delayed countless times now, with the development being so messy that studio Adhoc, which helped with writing
            not knowing what's happening with the project. Telltale still refuses to say anything about the project, except for the occasional social media post
            saying it's still in development" with no real screenshots or videos.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft decided to put all their eggs in one basket their new title "Skull and Bones", even claiming that it's qoute
            unqoute "the first AAAA game ever made", and to no one's surprise, it flopped harder than a fish on land. Ubisoft reportedly
            wasted an estimated $650 million to $850 million dollars. This just goes to show that when disappointing their fans, Ubisoft never fails.</p>

            <h1>Forsaken Hollows</h1>
            <p>Ever since Elden Ring Nightrein came out, people have wanted three main things: More bosses, new characters, and a new map. I'm

                new nightfarers and bosses along with something close to a new map with a shifting earth. Opinions have been somewhat mixed on this
                new DLC. </p>
