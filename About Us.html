            <h1>How we started</h1> 
                <p>So I started this website back around 2020 with some friends of mine, originally naming it "The Gaming hub",
                    a place really just for my friends and I to hang out back in 2012, but that obviously didn't last too long.
                    A couple of years later, my friends and I started to drift apart due to life and eventually stopped talking
                    completely, which really sucked. Back in 2016, I was looking for some old files on my laptop and found the
                    the site, which just flooded me with nostalgia after so long. After crying a bit from remembering how much
                    we used to talk and looking at old chat logs, I decided to start developing it into an actual site for 
                    the thing that brought us all together in the first place: Videogames. 
                </p>
        </main>
        <main>
            <h1>Here we are</h1>
            <p>Not gonna lie, it's been hurdle after hurdle to get to where the site is now, but I'm happy with how it's turned out.
                Our community may not be the biggest compared to some of the big boy sites, but I'll keep it going as qick as I can 
                to make sure people's love of videogames is as widespread as possible
